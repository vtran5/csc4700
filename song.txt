"Day Dreamer"

I dream too much
To ever give a fuck
'bout anything and everything
You care about
So I'll just sing
I sleep too much
I can't leave my bed
All the things
I have to do
I'd rather lay here for a few

So please
Don't wake me up
This dream I'm in
Is much to sweet
For me to care at all

I think too much
I can't escape my head
Trapped inside
Behind these eyes
Just hanging by a thread
Can't be alone
I don't trust myself
Hiding from these mirror balls
And secrets on the shelf

So please
Don't wake me up
This dream I'm in
Is much to sweet
For me to care at all

Sitting the dark
Cold and heavy sheet
The smell of fire
The taste of wine
Means nothing more to me
Waiting the phone
I trust you won't call
Wish I had
Something to do
Just wander down the hall

So please
Don't wake me up
This dream I'm in
Is much to sweet
For me to care at all
